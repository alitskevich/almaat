# Systems

![Systems](/images/1-reality/07-system.svg)

Things as queues of presentations over a flow: the participants, the communication that couples them, and what the whole exhibits that no part does.

## Thing and Trajectory

**`Thing(Entity)`** := a `Queue` of [`View`](../0-math/06-views.md)s of a single `Entity` across a [`Flow`](02-process.md#parts-of-a-process).

> `Thing(Entity) := [View(Entity, Step[i])]`

---

**`Transition(Thing)`** := a change of `State` of a `Thing` between consecutive `Step` — a triple of moment, before-state, after-state.

> `Transition(Thing) := (Step[i], State(Thing, Step[i]), State(Thing, Step[i+1]))`

---

**`Trajectory(Thing)`** := the track of a `Thing`'s `State`s across its `Step`s.

> `Trajectory(Thing) := [State(Thing, Step[i]) for Step[i] in indices(Thing)]`

*NOTE*: the realized `Trajectory` is one sample path of the `Flow`; the space of possible `Trajectory`s is the [`Circuit`](02-process.md#parts-of-a-process)'s support unrolled. A `Trajectory` is a function of `Thing` only where every `Step` is a point mass.

## System and Participant

**`System`** := a `Set` of `Participant`s coupled by mutual `Communication`.

> `System := {Participant} :: ∀P ∈ System: ∃Q ∈ System: Communication(P → Q) ≠ 0 ∨ Communication(Q → P) ≠ 0`

---

**`Participant`** := a `Thing` that produces `Communication` toward another `Thing`.

> `Participant(P) :: P IS Thing ∧ ∃Q ≠ P: Communication(P → Q) ≠ 0`

*NOTE*: the atomic unit of a `System` — defined by its role in the network of `Communication`, not by its internal structure. Every `Participant` is a [`Source`](../0-math/01-sets.md#sets): it must produce output in order to communicate.

---

**`State of a Participant`** := the `State` of a `Participant` at a given `Step`.

> `State(U, Step) :: State over the Views of U at Step`

*NOTE*: what `Behavior` projects outward and what `Attention` of others receives.

## Communication

**`Communication`** := projection of one `Participant`'s `Behavior` into another's `Attention`.

> `Communication(A → B) := Attention(B) . Behavior(A)`

*NOTE*: asymmetric: `A → B ≠ B → A`. Operates across a single `Step` — A's output at `Step[i]` becomes B's input at `Step[i+1]`.

---

**`Behavior`** := a `Participant`'s projection of its own `State` toward other `Participant`s.

> `Behavior(A) :: State(A) → View`

*NOTE*: the sending half — the externally-visible aspect of a `Participant` — what it contributes to the `System`.

---

**`Attention`** := a `Participant`'s selection of *other* `Participant`s' `Behavior` into its own `State`.

> `Attention(B) :: View → State(B)`

*NOTE*: the receiving half. `Attention` is selective: not every available `Behavior` enters a `Participant`'s input.

## Coupling

**`Environment`** := the part of the `System` that has mutual `Communication` with a `Participant`.

> `Environment(P) := {Q ∈ System : Communication(P → Q) ≠ 0 ∧ Communication(Q → P) ≠ 0}`

*NOTE*: the `Participant`'s local neighborhood — the subset of the `System` it actually exchanges `Behavior`/`Attention` with.

---

**`Interface`** := a constraint on the `Behavior` of `Participant`s relative to each other.

> `Interface :: admissible(Behavior, Attention) → {0, 1}`

*NOTE*: a behavioral contract — a formal specification of admissible `Communication` patterns.

---

**`Coupling`** := the persistence of mutual `Communication` between two `Participant`s across multiple `Step`s.

> `Coupling(A, B) := | {Step[i] : Communication(A → B) ≠ 0 ∧ Communication(B → A) ≠ 0 at Step[i]}|`

---

**`Feedback`** := a `Composition` in which a `Participant`'s `Behavior` flows, through other `Participant`s, back into its own `Attention`.

> `Feedback(A) :: ∃ path A → ... → A in the Coupling graph`

*NOTE*: positive `Feedback` amplifies divergence from a `State`; negative `Feedback` restores it.

## The Whole

**`Emergence`** := a `Behavior` of a `System` not present in any individual `Participant`.

> `Emergence :: Behavior(System) ⊄ ⋃ Behavior(Participant)`

*NOTE*: the signature of `System`s: the whole exhibits properties no part can. Not predictable from the `State` of individual `Participant`s alone — it must be observed under `Communication`.

---

**`Equilibrium`** := a `State` of the `System` at which all `Communication` among `Participant`s balance, yielding a [`Halt`](02-process.md#landmarks-of-a-flow) for the whole.

> `Equilibrium :: Circuit(State_sys) = δ_Step`

*NOTE*: the system-level `Halt`. Disturbance by external `Communication` yields either return to the same `Equilibrium` (stable), drift to a different one (metastable), or unbounded divergence (unstable).
