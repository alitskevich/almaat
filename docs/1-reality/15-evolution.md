# Evolution

![Evolution](/images/1-reality/15-evolution.svg)

`Evolution` is the dynamics of how a `System` changes its `Potency` over `Circumstances` shift.

This file holds the trajectories: how a `Paradigm` improves, preserves, decays, or breaks. What bounds those trajectories is in [Limits](16-limits.md).

## Trajectories

**`Evolution`** := a change of `Paradigm` toward strictly greater `Potency` across some `Plan`s, with no `Plan` worsened, under given `Circumstances`.

> `Evolution :: Paradigm → Paradigm'| ∀Plan: Potency(Plan, Paradigm', Circumstances) ≥ Potency(Plan, Paradigm, Circumstances) ∧ ∃Plan: strict >`

---

**`Adaptation`** := a change of `Paradigm` tracking a change in `Circumstances` so that `Potency` is approximately preserved.

> `Adaptation :: (Paradigm, Circumstances → Circumstances') → Paradigm'| Potency(Paradigm', Circumstances') ≥ Potency(Paradigm, Circumstances) − ε`

---

**`Stagnation`** := persistence of `Paradigm` despite shifting `Circumstances`, with strictly declining `Potency`.

> `Stagnation :: Paradigm = const, Circumstances → Circumstances' | Potency(Paradigm, Circumstances') < Potency(Paradigm, Circumstances)`

---

**`Regression`** := a change of `Paradigm` itself toward lower `Potency` under unchanged `Circumstances`.

> `Regression :: Paradigm → Paradigm' | Potency(Paradigm', Circumstances) < Potency(Paradigm, Circumstances)`

## Branching

**`Crisis`** := a `State` at a [`Bifurcation`](02-process.md#landmarks-of-a-flow): the existing `Paradigm` is inadequate to current `Circumstances`, AND no replacement `Paradigm` is yet attainable.

> `Crisis :: Potency(Paradigm, Circumstances) ≈ 0 ∧ ∄Paradigm'_attainable: Potency(Paradigm', Circumstances) > Potency(Paradigm, Circumstances)`

*NOTE*: the branching point: either [`Breakthrough`](16-limits.md) yields a new `Paradigm`, or the `Agent`'s capacity to participate in the `System` collapses.

---

**`Synergy`** := a `Solution` whose `Success` is shared by all participating `Agent`s.

> `Synergy :: ∀A ∈ Participants: Success(A)`

*NOTE*: positive-sum: mutual benefit. The highest-quality `Solution` within a multi-`Agent` `System` — and the only kind compatible with sustained `Evolution`.
