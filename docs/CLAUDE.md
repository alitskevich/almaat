# ALMAAT — Project Guide

ALMAAT is a general-purpose framework for cognitive modeling, written as a layered
knowledge base in Markdown. It builds a single ontology from one irreducible primitive
(the `Azon`) up through `Set`, `Graph`, `Language`, `Sequence`, `Space`, dynamic
`System`, `Mind`, `Agent`, and `Growth`, then applies that ontology to the human,
society, and daily practice.

This file is the authoritative instruction set for working in this repository. Follow it
for every edit. When it conflicts with a one-off request, ask before deviating.

## Core task: ingesting content

The recurring job is **ingesting source material** the user pastes in or points to by URL:

1. **Translate to English.** English Terms are canonical. Render non-English source into
   clear English first.
2. **Reduce to basic terminology.** Rewrite in plain language. Strip jargon, marketing
   tone, and filler. Reuse the framework's own vocabulary (the capitalized `Terms`)
   wherever a concept already has one. Also fill gaps with content from external resources.
3. **Place it in the right file.** Embed it in the existing file whose topic it extends.
   Create a new file only when no existing topic fits (see Routing and Naming below).
4. **Keep the indexes current.** Any new file, or any change to a file's title or scope,
   must be reflected in `INDEX.md`. A stale index is a bug.

Never paste raw source. Ingestion means rewriting into the framework's voice.

### Worked example

> Source (pasted, Russian): "Дисциплина важнее мотивации — это привычка, а не черта характера."

- Translate → "Discipline matters more than motivation — it is a habit, not a character trait."
- Reduce → state it plainly in the framework's register, mark concepts as `Terms`.
- Route → this extends self-discipline, so it goes into `7-mastery/04-discipline.md`; no new file.
- Index → no title/scope change, so `INDEX.md` stays as-is. (If scope had widened, update it.)

## Repository layout

Content lives under numbered section folders, each one ontological layer or applied domain:

| Folder         | Domain                                                                         | File numbers      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `0-math`       | Formal foundations: `Azon`, `Set`, `Composition`, `Graph`, `Numerals`, `Structures`, presentational view, formal `Language`. | `00`–`07`         |
| `1-reality`    | Dynamics & metaphysics: `Process`, `System`, `Probability`, `Entropy`, `Evolution`, `Limits`, `Being`, transcendence, the given. | `02`, `07`, `10`, `14`–`16`, `22`, `24`, `27` |
| `2-mind`       | Knowing & mind: knowing, `Knowledge`, `Proof`, `Computation`, `Reasoning`, `Teleos`, free will, `Intellect`, `Mind`, the predictive brain, scientific method. | `04`–`13`, `90` |
| `4-human`      | The human: `Human`, `Rajdo` and approaching it, truth & faith, happiness & greatness, `Animal`, the self & death, the `Manifesto`. | `21`, `23`–`26`, `28`, `29`, `98` |
| `7-mastery`    | Mastery and its stages: mastery, mindset, vision, discipline, habits, environment, attention, productivity, learning, luck, clear thinking. | own domain, `01`–`11` |
| `8-socium`     | The collective: socium, ecology, culture, influence, identity, trances, conformism, politics. | `30`–`37`         |
| `8-sustain`    | Sustaining the self: security, frame, de-escalation, manipulation, reading, hostility, boundaries, defense. | own domain, `06`–`13` |
| `9-vitality`   | The body: vitality, recovery, nutrition, energy. | own domain, `02`–`05` |

The leading digit on a folder (`0-`, `1-`, `2-`, `4-`, `7-`, `8-`) places it within the ontology's
ordering. The digit `8-` is shared by two applied folders (`8-socium`, `8-sustain`); gaps (`3-`,
`5-`, `6-`) are reservations for future layers. Don't renumber a folder casually — it cascades
through every cross-reference.

Applied software engineering (formerly `9-engx`) has been extracted into its own repository,
[arrmagazin/engx](https://github.com/arrmagazin/engx). Do not route engineering material here.

Special top-level files, prefixed with `_` or named `welcome`:

- `welcome.md` — the framework's entry page.
- `_quotes.md` — a curated, numbered list of quotations.
- `_translations.md` — canonical English Term → Belarusian-rooted equivalent. Reverse map
  only; English stays canonical in content.
- `INDEX.md` — master content index (all sections and files).

## Routing: where does material go?

1. Identify the layer the material belongs to (formal, dynamic, mind, human, collective,
   mastery/discipline, sustain) and pick that folder.
2. Within the folder, find the file whose frontmatter `description` already covers the
   topic. If one does, embed there.
3. Only if no file fits, create a new one — and update `_translations.md` (if it coins
   canonical Terms) and `INDEX.md`.

## Naming

Content files are `NN-topic.md`, lowercase hyphenated slug, `NN` a two-digit ordering
number. Across the ontology folders (`0-math`, `1-reality`, `2-mind`, `4-human`,
`8-socium`) the numbers **ascend roughly with ontological depth** — `0-math` `00`–`07`,
`1-reality` `02`–`27`, `2-mind` `04`–`90`, `4-human` `21`–`98`, `8-socium` `30`–`37` —
with `90` and `98` reserved for capstones (the scientific method, the manifesto).

This is **not one global sequence**: those ranges overlap, and seven numbers repeat
across folders (`02`, `04`, `05`, `06`, `07`, `10`, `24`). The number orders a file
within its own folder and signals roughly where the folder sits; it is not unique
tree-wide. `7-mastery`, `8-sustain` and `9-vitality` are applied-domain folders, each an
**independent number space** (`7-mastery` restarts at `01`; `8-sustain` keeps `06`–`13` and
`9-vitality` keeps `02`–`05` from their pre-split numbering).

When adding a file, take the next free number in that folder's existing range. Do not
renumber existing files just to keep the sequence dense.

## Frontmatter and title

Frontmatter is exactly three fields, in this order: `title`, `description`, `keywords`.
`description` is one sentence; it is quoted, so backticks come out and inner quotes are
escaped. It is what the indexes quote. Do not reintroduce `license`, `created`,
`modified`, or `source` — they were dropped as noise on 2026-08-26.

Every content file then opens with a single H1 title and goes straight into the body:

```markdown
---
title: "Dynamic Processes"
description: "The Process as a controlled Queue of Words: its Circuit, the kinds of Circuit, and the landmarks of a Flow."
keywords: [reality, process, circuit, flow]
---

# Dynamic Processes

## Parts of a Process
```

**No preface.** Nothing sits between the title and the first heading: no intro line
restating the `description`, no spine table, no enumeration of the folder's other files.
Navigation lives in `INDEX.md`; cross-reference a specific Term where it is used.

(Banner images were removed on 2026-09-05; content files carry no images.)

## Terminology and formatting

- **Canonical Terms are capitalized and backticked**: `Azon`, `Set`, `Agent`, `Flow`.
  Cross-reference related Terms with relative links, e.g. `[Systems](1-reality/07-system.md)`.
- **Formal definitions are prose, not tables.** A definition opens with the bolded backticked
  Term, then `:=`, then the defining clause; the formula follows as a blockquote, and `---`
  separates consecutive definitions. See `0-math/00-azon.md`, the reference example:

  ```markdown
  **`Zero`** := `Azon` that *always* responds with itself

  > `Zero := x → Zero`

  *DEF*: response with `Zero` *called* `empty`, otherwise - `valent`.
  ```

  (This rule previously mandated `Term | Definition | Formula | Notes` tables, which no file in
  the ontology layers has ever used — including the reference example it cited. Corrected
  2026-08-16 in favour of what the tree actually does.)
- **Tables are for enumerations**, not definitions: parallel lists of moves, forms, biases, or
  comparisons, where every row shares a shape. The applied folders (`7-mastery`, `8-socium`,
  `8-sustain`, `9-vitality`) use them heavily and correctly.
- **Prose** is plain and direct — basic terminology, short sentences, no filler.
  Declarative, defined, unhurried.
- **Backticks mark a defined Term, and nothing else.** A backticked Capitalized name must
  resolve to a definition somewhere in `docs/`. Enumeration tables bold their first column
  without backticks (`**Deduction**`, `**Monoid**`), because those rows name entries, not
  Terms. An external concept the book does not own stays lowercase — *modules*, *vector
  spaces*, *ego depletion*.
- **A definition may only name Terms from its own folder or an earlier one.** Dependencies
  run downward through the layer order above. Where a definition needs a higher-layer Term,
  either the Term belongs lower (move it) or the definition should generalize to a
  lower-layer one — `Freedom` takes a `Participant`, not an `Agent`.
- **Four forms declare a Term**, and all four count:

  ```markdown
  **`Term`** := clause                        the ordinary form
  **`Term` / `Alias`** := clause              two names, one definition
  **`Term`** of arity `n` on a `Set` := …     a qualifier before the `:=`
  *DEF*: a response with `Zero` is *called* `empty`   a label introduced in passing
  ```

  A Term introduced only inside another definition's definiens is **not** declared. Write
  it as its own definition instead.
- When a new canonical Term is coined, add it to `_translations.md` under the section for
  the file that defines it. Newly-proposed Belarusian forms get a trailing asterisk
  (`Razvoda*`); the asterisk marks a proposed *form*, not a proposed placement. A compound
  gloss reuses the gloss already assigned to its parts, so it can be decomposed:
  `TransitionMatrix` is `Mantra Perexodaw*` because `Matrix` is `Mantra` and `Transition`
  is `Perexod`.

## Syncing `INDEX.md`

To bring `INDEX.md` back in sync after a stretch of content edits, diff against the last
recorded sync baseline instead of re-reading the whole tree:

```bash
git diff <baseline-commit>..HEAD -- docs/
```

This surfaces exactly which `docs/*.md` files were **added, renamed, removed, or
retitled** since the baseline. For each change, update the matching `INDEX.md` entry
(link path, title, and the frontmatter `description`). Then record the new baseline:

- **Last full reconciliation:** 2026-08-27 — `INDEX.md` regenerated from the tree at
  `0e1dc84`. All 71 content files are indexed exactly once; each entry's link text is
  that file's frontmatter `title` and its blurb is the frontmatter `description`,
  quoted character for character and verified by re-extracting both and diffing.
  `0-math/07-language.md` had had no entry at all. This closed a 192-commit revision
  pass over `docs/` that also emptied the undefined-Term class (every backticked
  Capitalized name now resolves to a definition), removed every upward reference from
  a definition to a higher layer, and rebuilt `_translations.md` to 330 rows with no
  duplicate gloss and no row for a Term the book does not define.
- **Baseline commit:** `0e1dc84` (2026-08-27) — the commit at which `INDEX.md` was
  regenerated from frontmatter. Diff from here for the next sync.

Notes:

- INDEX entries are grouped by ontological-layer section; the description text mirrors each
  file's frontmatter `description` (see Frontmatter and title).
- `INDEX.md` is the only navigation surface. No section has an `index.md`, and the per-folder
  spine tables were removed on 2026-08-26 — `7-mastery/01-mastery.md`, `8-sustain/01-sustain.md`,
  `2-mind/04-knowing.md` and `8-socium/30-socium.md` no longer list their siblings. The last two
  were nothing but that table: `2-mind/04-knowing.md` (11 lines) and `8-socium/30-socium.md`
  (9 lines) still await content or deletion.
- **Run `npm run check-docs` before committing content edits.** It resolves every relative `.md`
  link and every `#anchor` in `docs/`, and `--conventions <dir>` additionally checks the three
  frontmatter fields and the single H1.
  Pre-existing breakage is listed in `scripts/check-docs.baseline.txt`, so the gate is
  "no new failures"; fix an entry and delete its line.

## Editing checklist

1. Source translated to English and reduced to basic terminology.
2. Content routed to the correct file (or a correctly named new file created).
3. Frontmatter + title conform to the convention above, with no preface between the
   title and the first heading.
4. New Terms backticked in text and, if canonical, added to `_translations.md`.
5. `INDEX.md` updated to match.
6. Relative links checked — they must resolve to real files.
