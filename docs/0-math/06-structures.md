# Structures

## Definitions

---

**`Dependency<Form>`** := `Azon`

- *from* (one `View<Form>` := `**Source**`)
- *into* (another `View<Form>` := `**Target**`).

> `Dependency<Form> := Source<Form> ⇒ Target<Form>`

---

**`KeyMask`** := `Mask` that preserves `Bijective` correspondence between the `Points` of `Origin` and its (`Points` of `View` := `**Key**`).

> `KeyMask<Origin> := Mask :: ∃(Mask.p → p)`

---

**`Operation<Sⁿ>`** := `Dependency` *from* `S×ⁿ` *into* `S`.

> `Operation<S> := S^ⁿ ⇒ S`

| Term | Arity | Signature | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Constant** | `0-ary` | `() ⇒ S` | `unit: () => 1`, `zero: () => 0` |
| **Unary** | `1-ary` | `S ⇒ S` | `inc: a => a+1`, `neg: a => -a`, `inv: a => a⁻¹`, `⊥: a => ¬a` |
| **Binary** | `2-ary` | `S × S ⇒ S` | `add: (a,b) => a+b`, `mul: (a,b) => a·b`, `∧, ∨` |
| **n-ary** | `n-ary` | `Sⁿ ⇒ S` | `combine: (a₁, …, aₙ) => …` |

---

**`Law`** := a `Predicate` on the `Dependencies`.

> `Law<B ⊆ Basis> := Predicate<{ Dependency }>`

| Law | Formula | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Inverse** | `∀a ∈ S: ∃a⁻¹ ∈ S: a * a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ * a = e` | Every element is undoable; requires identity |
| **Idempotent** | `a * a = a` | Repeating an operand has no effect |
| **Reflexive** | `∀a ∈ S: a * a` holds | For relations: every element relates to itself |
| **Symmetric** | `∀a, b ∈ S: a * b ⟹ b * a` | For relations; with reflexivity and transitivity, defines an equivalence |
| **Antisymmetric** | `∀a, b ∈ S: (a * b ∧ b * a) ⟹ a = b` | Distinguishes orders from equivalences |
| **Transitive** | `∀a, b, c ∈ S: (a * b ∧ b * c) ⟹ a * c` | Chains relate |
| **Associative** | `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)` | Order of grouping is irrelevant |
| **Commutative** | `a * b = b * a` | Order of operands is irrelevant |
| **Distributive** | `a * (b ⊕ c) = (a * b) ⊕ (a * c)` | One operation distributes over another |
| **Absorption** | `a ∨ (a ∧ b) = a` and `a ∧ (a ∨ b) = a` | Couples two operations in a lattice |
| **Latin square** | `∀a, b ∈ S: ∃! x, y ∈ S: a * x = b ∧ y * a = b` | Unique left- and right-solutions; defines a quasigroup |
| **Jacobi** | `a * (b * c) + b * (c * a) + c * (a * b) = 0` | A weakened associativity used in Lie algebras |

---

**`Structure`** := `Set` of `Dependencies` under the `Law`.

> `Structure<Dependencies,Law> := S{ Dependency } :: Law(S) === T`

## Common Structures

**`Pointed Unary System`** :=`Structure` having `Units` with unary `Operation`.

> `zero: () => 0, unit: () => 1, inv: (x) => x == 1 ? 0 : 1`

---

**`POSet`** := partially ordered `Set`.

> `≤: (a,b) => (a < b) ? T : F :: Reflexive + Antisymmetric + Transitive`

---

**`Setoid`** := `Set` with equivalence.

> `eq: (a,b) => a == b ? T : F :: Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive`

*NOTE*: `Setoid` and `Poset` differ by one `Law`: Symmetric gives equivalence, Antisymmetric gives partial order.

### Magma and Descendants

**`Magma`** / `Groupoid` := `Structure` with a single binary `Operation`.

> `op: (a,b) => c`

---

**`Quasi-group`** := `Magma` under the Latin square `Law`.

> `∃! x, y: a * x = b ∧ y * a = b`

---

**`Loop`** := `Quasi-group` with identity.

---

**`Semi-group`** := associative `Magma`.

> `combine: a,b => (...) => b(a(...))`

---

**`Semi-lattice`** := idempotent and commutative `Semi-group`.

---

**`Monoid`** := `Semi-group` with a `unit` (LR-identity).

> `unit: () => 1`

---

**`Group`** := `Monoid` with an `inverse` (LR-inverse).

> `inverse: a => -a`

---

**`Abelian Group`** := `Group` with commutative `sum`.

> `sum: (a,b) => c :: Associative + Commutative`

## Ringoid Structures

**`Ringoid`** := `Set` with `add` and `multiply`, multiplication distributing over addition.

---

**`Semiring`** := `Ringoid` that is also a `Monoid` under each `Operation`.

---

**`Near-ring`** := `Set` whose `add` is a `Group` and whose `multiply` is a `Semi-group`, distributing on one side only.

---

**`Ring`** := `Semiring` whose `add` is an `Abelian Group`.

---

**`Boolean Ring`** := commutative `Ring` with idempotent multiplication.

---

**`Field`** := commutative `Ring` with a multiplicative `inverse` for every nonzero element.

## Lattice Structures

**`Lattice`** := `Poset` with `∧` (meet, infimum) and `∨` (join, supremum).

> `Lattice :: Commutative + Associative + Absorption`

---

**`Complete Lattice`** := `Lattice` with arbitrary meets and joins.

---

**`Bounded Lattice`** := `Lattice` with `1` (greatest, top) and `0` (least, bottom).

> `0 ≤ x ≤ 1 :: ∀x ∈ S`

---

**`Complemented Lattice`** := `Bounded Lattice` with unary `⊥` complementation.

> `a ∨ a⊥ = 1 ∧ a ∧ a⊥ = 0`

---

**`Distributive Lattice`** := `Lattice` where meet and join distribute over each other.

---

**`Boolean Algebra`** := `Complemented Lattice` that is also a `Distributive Lattice`.
