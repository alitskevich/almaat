# Sets, Equivalence, Topology

![Sets, Equivalence, Topology](/images/0-math/01-sets.svg)

## Sets

**`Set`** := an `Azon` whose `Values` are either `fixed` or `empty`.

> `Set := x → (x | Zero)`

---

**`Element`** := a `valent` `Value` of a `Set`.

> `a ∈ S ⟺ S(a) = a`

*DEF*: An `Element` **belongs to** a `Set`; it is *inside* not *outside*.

*DEF*: the `Set` **contains** the `Element`.

*NOTE*: By `AXIOM-2`: s`∉ S`. By `AXIOM-1`: `0 ∉ S` and s`∉ 0`.

*NOTE*: `Unit` as a Set contains all `Azons` except itself and `Zero`: `∀x ∉ {0, 1}: x ∈ 1`.

---

**`Subset`** := A `Set` all of whose `Elements` belong to a reference `Set`.

> `A ⊆ B :: ∀x: x ∈ A ⟹ x ∈ B`

*NOTE*: Reflexive: s`⊆ S`. Transitive: `A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ C ⟹ A ⊆ C`. Min/Max: `0 ⊆ S ⊆ 1`.

---

**`Domain`** := `Set` of valent Signs of an `Azon`.

> `DOM(A) := {x : A(x) ≠ 0}`

---

**`Codomain`** := `Set` of valent Values of an `Azon`.

> `COD(A) := {y : ∃x, A(x) = y ∧ y ≠ 0}`

*DEF*: An `Azon` is **endogenous** if `DOM(A) = COD(A)`.

*NOTE*: Any `Set` is endogenous.

*DEF*: `Azons` are **endemic** if `DOM(A₁) = DOM(A₂) ∧ COD(A₁) = COD(A₂)`.

## Presence and Absence

**`Presence`** := `Set` of all `Azon` whose `Domain` or `Codomain` contains the reference `Azon`.

> `APPEAR(a) := {X : a ∈ DOM(X) ∨ a ∈ COD(X)}`

*NOTE*: The existential scope of an entity — every context in which it participates.

---

**`Universe`** := `Set` closed under `Presence`.

> `P :: ∀k ∈ P, APPEAR(k) ⊆ P`

*NOTE*: The Universe of discourse for logical reasoning — every entity's full set of contexts is also inside.

---

**`Complement`** := Set of all Elements of Universe that do NOT belongs to the reference `Set`.

> `!S := {x ∈ P : x ∉ S}`

*NOTE*: Always relative to a `Universe`.

---

**`Absence`** := `Set` of all `Azons` that do NOT belongs to the `Universe`.

> `Absence := {x : x ∉ P}`

*NOTE*: `Complement` is complement *within* `P`; `Absence` is complement *of* `P` — the impossible relative to a given Universe of discourse.

## Topology

**`Collection`** := A `Set` of `Set`s.

> `K := {S₁, S₂, ..., Sₙ}`

---

**`Intersection`** := `Set` of `Elements` which belong to every `Set` of the `Collection`.

> `⋂K := {x : ∀S ∈ K, x ∈ S}`

*DEF*: A `Collection` is **non-intersecting** if no two of its `Sets` share an `Element`: `∀S₁ ≠ S₂ ∈ K: ⋂{S₁, S₂} = 0`.

*DEF*: for two `Set`s, `A ∩ B := ⋂{A, B}` — the binary form used where a `Collection` is not needed.

---

**`Union`** := `Set` of `Elements` which belong to at least one `Set` of the `Collection`.

> `⋃K := {x : ∃S ∈ K, x ∈ S}`

*DEF*: A `Collection` is **saturated to `S`** if `⋃K = S`.

*DEF*: for two `Set`s, `A ∪ B := ⋃{A, B}` — the binary form.

---

**`Set-Difference`** := `Set` of `Elements` in the `Union` of the `Collection` but NOT in the reference `Set`.

> `SetDiff(K, S) := {x : x ∈ ⋃K ∧ x ∉ S}`

---

**`PowerSet`** := The `Collection` of all `Subset` of the reference `Set`.

> `2^S := {Q : Q ⊆ S}`

---

**`Cluster`** := A `Collection` that is non-intersecting AND saturated to a reference `Set`.

> `Cluster(K, S) :: (∀S₁ ≠ S₂ ∈ K: ⋂{S₁, S₂} = 0) ∧ ⋃K = S`

*NOTE*: A partition — mutually disjoint `Sets` whose `Union` covers the reference `Set`.

*NOTE*: `{!S, S}` is a `Cluster` saturated to the `Universe` `P`.

## Equivalence Relations

**`Intensional Distinguishability`** := There exists an `Azon`-probe that responds to `a` and `b` with different values.

> `DIFF(a, b) := ∃x: x(a) ≠ x(b)`

---

**`Extensional Equivalence`** := No `Azon` in the `Universe` receives different responses from `a` and `b`.

> `EEQ(a, b) := ¬∃x: a(x) ≠ b(x)`

---

**`Total Equality`** := Both Intensionally non-Distinguishable by probes AND Extensionally equivalent in response.

> `a = b := ¬DIFF(a, b) ∧ EEQ(a, b)`

---

**`Partial Equality`** := The `Set` of inputs on which two `Azon` respond total-equally.

> `PEQ(a, b) := {x : a(x) = b(x)}`

*NOTE*: Two `Azon` are **partially-equal** up to `PEQ` precision.
